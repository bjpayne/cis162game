### How To Play

Move around the map using the direction keys. Pickup items you find and
collect the clues. Inside of a room you can pickup items and make a guess about
the murder mystery. Correct guesses for each category (Person, Place, Weapon)
will be recorded. Take care not to ingest the possible murder weapon.

In order to move around you will need health. Health is gained by consuming
items you find around the map.

In order to guess you will need to be inside of a room, and posses the murder
item. There are six possible suspects that could have committed the crime.

Health is drained by moving around. If you run out of health you die.

*Have Fun!*
