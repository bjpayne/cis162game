### How To Play

Move around the map using the direction buttons. Pickup items you find and
collect the clues. Inside of a room you can pickup items and make a guess about
the murder mystery. Correct guesses for each category (Suspect, Location, Item)
will be recorded below the menu buttons.

In order to guess you will need to be inside of a room, and posses the random
item. There are six possible suspects that could have committed the crime.

Health is drained by moving around. If you run out of health you die.
Inside the hallway you will find items you can consume to replenish your health.
Take care not to ingest any possible murder weapons.

*Have Fun!*
